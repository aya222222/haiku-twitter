# Haiku twitter

It's basically twitter clone built with MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). 
User can post a haiku, and delete, comment, update it.
For authentication, I implemented custom authentication function and also Google OAuth 2.0. 
I implemented MongoDB for all database. And for image, I used cloudinary.
